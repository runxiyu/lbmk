# I.MX8 SOCs require a nonfree firmware for the DDR4 controller. In some
# documentation, I didn't find that requirement mentioned, but instead
# there are still nonfree files mentioned. So I assume that they might
# somehow contain code for that nonfree DDR4 controller, but it might be
# worth checking if it's the case or not. The DDR4 controller firmware is not
# signed. In addition the I.MX8 HDMI controller requires a signed firmware.

# The SRK tool is a tool that is involved in one way or another with

# exists or if could easily be replaced with a free software implementation.
# In any case the I.MX6 and I.MX5 can proabably be setup for encrypted or
# authenticated boot with free software tools. The first and second versions
# of the USB Armory has documentation on how to do that.
