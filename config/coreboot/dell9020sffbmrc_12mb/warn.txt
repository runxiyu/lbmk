Completely stable with graphics, but IOMMU disabled by default; graphics cards only work with IOMMU turned off. Intel graphics works fine with IOMMU turned on. IOMMU is needed for Qubes to work properly. To turn on IOMMU, do this to your ROM before flashing (ONLY do this if using Intel graphics): ./nvramtool -C libreboot.rom -w iommu=Enable

*This* target uses Intel MRC (a binary blob) for memory controller initialisation.
If you want *libre* initialisation (recommended), use the *nri* targets instead,
e.g. dell9020sff-nri_12mb or dell9020mt-nri_12mb

These MRC-based targets will be *removed* in a future Libreboot release. It is
strongly recommended that you use the NRI-based targets (Native RAM initialisation).

This version uses Broadwell MRC, which is compatible on Haswell machines.
