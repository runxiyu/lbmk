Battery indicator not working yet. S3 suspend/resume may be broken. May shut down instead of throttle on high CPU temperature; use the intel_pstate driver to cap speeds, and monitor performance via CPU stress test and lm-sensors/xsensors utility, before using the machine regularly.

Nvidia GPU on this model doesn't work when you try xorg; xorg will hang. Use "nomodeset" under Linux, when booting. On BSD, the nv driver works ok but can get very slow-slideshow-y when dragging windows, yet rendered video will usually run smooth; use a tiling window manager on BSD systems, or again use software rendering.
