Subject: [PATCH 36/39] nb/haswell: Fully disable iGPU when dGPU is used

My earlier patch disabled decode *and* disabled the iGPU itself, but
a subsequent revision disabled only VGA decode. Upon revisiting, I
found that, actually, yes, you also need to disable the iGPU entirely.

Tested on Dell 9020 SFF using broadwell MRC, with both iGPU and dGPU.
With this patch, the iGPU is completely disabled when you install a
graphics card, but the iGPU is available to use when no graphics card
is present.

For more context, see:

    nb/haswell: Disable iGPU when dGPU is used

And look at the Gerrit comments:

https://review.coreboot.org/c/coreboot/+/80717/

So, my original submission on change 80717 was actually correct.
This patch fixes the issue. I tested on iGPU and dGPU, with both
broadwell and haswell mrc.bin.
