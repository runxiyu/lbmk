Presumably fully stable, but see lbmk issue 179: https://codeberg.org/libreboot/lbmk/issues/179 - T60 on just battery power had the error in GRUB: alloc magic is broken at 0x7b1aedf0: 0 ----- the rev for Libreboot 2024050x is set to the LB 202306235 rev (February 2023) for now. I still think the users with that issue, and there weren't that many, just had bad RAM. GRUB shows that error on bad RAM, and I've seen it in that case on other machines too. So this machine is most likely fully stable, but I'm marking it unstable until we know fully what we're dealing with.
